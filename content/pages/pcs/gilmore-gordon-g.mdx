## Personal Details and Notes

A personality that is a cross between Goldblumâ€™s character in _Jurassic Park_ and Dale Gribble in _King of the Hill_. Tries to keep his theories (mostly) to himself at work and in public, but private life is different. Especially when they can talk to their Conspiracy Friend.

Agent was recruited because of their vast knowledge of various Middle Eastern and North African cultures and willingness to believe in supernatural causes. Agent agreed because fuck yeah, they get to see all these things in person that _OTHER PEOPLE_ just called crackpot conspiracy theories. **THEY WILL BE PROVEN RIGHT**!
