## Incident
A rural home in upstate New York has been flagged as a Point-Of-Interest for a deadly mass murder which took place upon the property recently wherein the owner of the home murdered his three children and wife before taking his own life in what investigators are calling "one of the most bizarre scenes [they have] ever encountered." Hypergeometric iconography and symbols were encountered and documented at the scene; suggesting a connection to extranormal influences.

Mostly shuttered businesses. Some nearby houses, a gas station, a convenience store, and a 24/7 Chinese restaurant.

Heard voice say "My brother was eaten by wolves on the Connecticut Turnpike." Found "Book of Nine Darknesses" ("Das Buch der Neun Dunkelheiten") in hole that led to torture chamber. Heard lots of German voices speaking when leaving barn.

## People

### Dearborn, Gary
Murderer. Killed family (except for son Hewie) and then himself. Iconography related to demons from medieval Europe and other just... odd symbols among a bunch of trash. Typically used in ritual sacrifice/offerings. Did weird things with strangers and didn't allow kids (at the time) to know what happened with the strangers.

### Dearborn, Hewie
Was not around for sacrifice. Left as soon as he could.
